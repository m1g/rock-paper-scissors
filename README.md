>**Ro! Sham! Bo!** - there are a few theories about the origin of this monicker for rock, paper, scissors. One theory suggests that it is of Chinese origin, dating around 206 BC whereby "Janken" or "Jan-ken-poh" as it was known then, was mistakingly misunderstood by English speakers and translated to "roshambo". Another theory suggests that the game was introduced to George Washington by a French general by the name of Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau during the American Revolution in the 1700s. Whatever the origin, it has now come to be known as Rock, Paper, Scissors!
